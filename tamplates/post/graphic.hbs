      <h3 class="mt-2">Graphic design is the practice of composing and arranging the visual elements of a project.</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Although the term “graphic design” has only been around since the 1920s, the art form itself has been an important part of visual communication for thousands of years. We can see early examples of graphic design in ancient manuscripts and even prehistoric cave paintings.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Today, the graphic design industry spans many different disciplines and specializations. It's an exciting field that’s perpetually evolving, but its adaptive nature can make it a little confusing for a newcomer to understand exactly what graphic design is and what types of work professionals do.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        If you’re looking for a guide to graphic design basics, you’re in the right place. Read on to find out precisely what graphic design is, see some examples, and learn about different design jobs.
      </p>
      <h1 class="mt-2 mb-2">What is graphic design in simple terms?</h1>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Graphic design is the practice of composing and arranging the visual elements of a project. Designing the layout of a magazine, creating a poster for a theatre performance, and designing packaging for a product are all examples of graphic design.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        In fact, almost everyone today practices some form of graphic design in their daily life — whether it’s adding text to an image for social media or color-coding a spreadsheet for work. Basically, if you're creating visual content, you're practicing some form of graphic design.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2">What is the main purpose of graphic design?</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Good graphic art streamlines communication. Just picture a spreadsheet with data analytics. A graphic designer might use different colors to highlight which metrics are rising and which are dropping, thus making it easier for the viewer to quickly understand what’s going well and what needs to be adjusted.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Well executed graphic design can also elicit an emotional response from the viewer or even motivate them to take action. The “sign up” page on a website, for example, is typically designed to entice visitors to join an email list or start a free trial. Meanwhile, food packaging design aims to make the food inside seem more appealing to eat.
